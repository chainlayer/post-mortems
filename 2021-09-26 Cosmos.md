## Summary

Cosmos validator was down for extended time without alarm going off. This resulted in the validator be jailed for approximately 16h. Validator was put back online and unjailed as soon as it was noticed.

## Cause

Migration of all validators to a new DC has been in progress for around a month. The cosmos validator was still running on the old DC. Due to human error alerting was silenced on the old DC because if fired on nodes that previously resided there. When the validator went down the alerts did fire but because of the silence they never reached the on-call. 

## Measures

* Changed standard operating procedures around adding silences. Silences are only allowed to be shortlived and need 4-eyes to be enabled.
* Finished migration of the Cosmos validator to the new DC
* Confirmed alerts would have fired on the new DC and double checked all active silences

## Corrective actions

* Reimbursed all delegators for the downtime slashing (0.01%) and missed rewards
* Contacted known delegators and posted post-mortem in Telegram
